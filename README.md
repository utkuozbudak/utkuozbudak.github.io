## Stand-alone Projects

### Face Recognition

Description of the face recognition project.

## Classification Problems

### Wine Quality Prediction

As a red wine enthusiast, I embarked on a quest to uncover the factors that contribute to a wine's quality. My Red Wine Quality Prediction project begins with exploratory data analysis, followed by the use of oversampling and SMOTE techniques to address class imbalance. I then trained and evaluated various models before selecting the best performer for further fine-tuning. Explore my process and findings in this exciting data-driven project from below links.

### Graduate Admission
I recall being thrilled when I applied to TUM for my Master's degree. As a result, I decided to investigate which factors are significant in enhancing one's admission chances, utilizing the Graduate Admission dataset from Kaggle. Initially, I conducted data analysis, followed by training and evaluating numerous models to determine the most effective one. Subsequently, additional analyses were performed. You can examine my approach and discoveries in this project through the links below.
