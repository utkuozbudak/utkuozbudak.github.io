### Wine Quality Prediction

As a red wine enthusiast, I embarked on a quest to uncover the factors that contribute to a wine's quality. My Red Wine Quality Prediction project begins with exploratory data analysis, followed by the use of oversampling and SMOTE techniques to address class imbalance. I then trained and evaluated various models before selecting the best performer for further fine-tuning. Explore my process and findings in this exciting data-driven project from below links
